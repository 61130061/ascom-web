# Introduction

Air-Space Control, Optimization, and Management Laboratory (ASCOM-LAB) was founded in 2019 by lecturers and students from the Department of Aeronautical Engineering, International Academy of Aviation Industry, King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand with potentials to have research cooperations with both private and government organizations in and out of Thailand. We are researchers and developers of the frontier intelligent aerospace technology. We are challenged by the detailed simulation and the complex computation of aerospace engineering problems. Our mission is to develop reliable and high-performance Air-Space control, optimization, and management systems with practical implementations of the advanced computerized method.

With the rapid growth of the aviation industry, air-space management has become increasingly complex, and new challenges arise with the introduction of advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous vehicles. Our laboratory is focused on addressing these challenges by conducting cutting-edge research on air traffic control automation, airspace optimization, and traffic flow management.

Our team of experts includes researchers and engineers with extensive experience in the fields of aerospace engineering, control systems, data analysis, and optimization. We work closely with industry partners, government agencies, and academic institutions to develop practical solutions that can be implemented in real-world scenarios.
Through our research, we aim to create a safer, more efficient, and sustainable air transportation system for the future. Thank you for your interest in our laboratory, and we look forward to working with you to shape the future of air-space control, optimization, and management.
